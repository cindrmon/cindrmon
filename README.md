<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm cindrmon!</h1>

I finally updated my ooga booga readme!

## whoami

I'm currently a student at my college studying Software Engineering, at the same time, practicing different programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices in terms of programming and problem solving.

## what i want to be

My ultimate goal is to participate and help out in projects both started and done by me, and with groups of people, including my friends or clients.

How my path goes would primarily revolve mostly on front-end development with vue, but it would lead me to do full-stack when the time comes.

## what i will (and want to) be using

Primarily, I would like my tech stack to be:

[**VueJS**](https://vuejs.org/) for frontend,

[**NestJS**](https://nestjs.com/) or [**Golang**](https://go.dev/) for backend,

alternatively, [**Ruby on Rails**](https://rubyonrails.org/) for fullstack, with either VueJS or [**Hotwire**](https://hotwired.dev/)

[**MongoDB**](https://mongodb.com/) or [**PostgreSQL**](https://postgresql.org/) for handling database,

[**AppWrite**](https://appwrite.io/) and other self-hosted services for mostly XaaS ({Platform, Backend, Software} as a Service)

[**Jenkins**](https://jenkins.io/) or [**CircleCI**](https://circleci.com) primarily for DevOps.

## what i already know (so far)

### JS/TS

The current programming language I've gotten used to since 2020, ever since I started studying [Web Development with Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

#### Frontend

1. [_Vue_](https://vuejs.org/) -- My framework of choice and what I'm most famililar in making front-end SPAs and UIs.
2. [_React_](https://reactjs.org/) -- My secondary framework of choice; i don't really use often.

#### Backend

1. [_Node_](https://nodejs.org/) + [_ExpressJS_](https://expressjs.com/) -- The framework I'm most familiar with when making backends.

#### SSRs

1. [_NuxtJS_](https://nuxtjs.org) -- Since I like vue so much, I would also be consistent in choosing a full-stack framework with nuxt. Although, I'm currently waiting for the stable release of nuxt 3, since i've been testing out nuxt 3 beta ever since it was released.
2. [_NextJS_](https://nextjs.org) -- The react alternative if ever I might need to learn since the demand is high, but it is also a favourable SSR framework.

#### ORMs

1. [_Mongoose_](https://mongoosejs.com/) -- The most familiar to me in terms of using an ORM for NoSQL (MongoDB).
2. [_Prisma_](https://prisma.io/) -- A framework I'm getting used to as well.

### Java

Learned in school, but I might rarely use.

### SSGs

1. [_Hugo_](https://gohugo.io/) -- One of my favorite SSGs, and is one of my currently used SSGs for some of my projects.

### SQL

I primarily have experience with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)/[MySQL](https://mysql.com/).

### Other Tools

1. [_Docker_](https://www.docker.com/) -- I've been very used to managing docker containers as is, but I do want to learn more advanced ways to orchestrate docker containers through [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and learn more about [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
2. [_Git_](https://git-scm.com/) -- Ever since I learned Git, i never looked back and it really made me an efficient programmer with it! I'm also learning more about how to take advantage of git even more, with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
3. [*Linux*](https://linux.org/) -- My primary OS for anything development-related. I know that linux should be referred as GNU+Linux, and I know that Linux is the kernel and not the OS, what I mean is that I have learned enough about Linux concepts to understand these things. And the distro I primarily use is [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/).

## what i'm planning to know

### [Go](https://go.dev/)

Still in the process of getting used to, but someday, this will be my primary programming language for backend. It is currently in my "want to use" list.

### [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

It is something I have grown fond of using due to its simplicity and flexibility, and it would be a really neat nice-to-have if some of the APIs have graphql, and I am also getting used to how it works.

### [_NestJS_](https://nestjs.com/)

The framework I'm getting used to thanks to its very simplex file structure (which is Angular-y).

### [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

Another framework I'm convinced enough to use that isn't TypeScipt and Golang, and I feel like I might enjoy this more since I have already gotten used to Object-Oriented Programming for the time being.

## what i already did (COMING SOON)
